TSV FORMAT:
BERT wants data to be in a tsv file with a specific format, (Four columns, and no header row).
Column 0: An ID for the row
Column 1: The label for the row (should be an int)
Column 2: A column of the same letter for all rows. 
Column 3: The text for the row

BERT comes with data loading classes that expects **train and dev files ** in the above format. 

We can use the train data to train our model, and the dev data as the validation set.

BERTâ€™s data loading classes can also use a test file but it expects the test file to be unlabelled. Therefore, I will be using the train and dev files instead.
