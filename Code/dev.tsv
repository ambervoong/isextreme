3	1	a	Just wait,they don't attack like that especially when they weakened now...
4	1	a	It sounds crazy to you but that is what will happen. This year mosul and raqqa will be back in islamic state's hands once more MARK MY WORDS
5	1	a	Or will they all be bombed to hell by Russia and/or Turkey? My worry is the servere uptick in violence we are about to see. Noting the US are no angels, not remotely. Fearing for all civilians. üò™

7	1	a	Same with me.
8	1	a	Was this really needed? Were they involved or just killed as ‚Äúretaliation‚Äù.
9	1	a	Dont forget 10,000 Sunnis were executed by iraqi regime for the 1500 safavids that died
10	1	a	Sad that a air fighter could just kill innocent people

12	1	a	How can you say that these photos are taken recently?
13	1	a	I thought you were an Alawite.
14	1	a	What facts? They are all lies! You have been pranked!
15	1	a	Ok, let`s say Iran didn`t train any Taliban fighters. What do you say about them hiding the death of Mullah Omar for over 2 years? How is it permissible in Islam to have a pledge of allegiance to a dead man?
16	1	a	US army involved killing civilian iraq million

23	1	a	So Assad (an Alawite) trained AQ (a Sunni group) to takeover Iraq in which year?
24	1	a	why is ISIS more into killing muslims than people from any other religion??....They never touched Israel when it was so close to them!!!
25	1	a	if that's true
26	1	a	And what happened to the survivor?
27	1	a	Total nonsense what you write there, Nidal. Ansaar al Furqan is an independent rebel group. Ideologically speaking, there are differences to AQ.
28	1	a	Thousands of dead ISIS terrorists? Beautiful...

32	1	a	Here we go again. You think they would fight the regime after all this massacre committed by the assadists yet they keep pointing their weapons only towards those who are fighting the assadists.
33	1	a	If you adopt a child in Islaam he will keep his biological name so Ibrahim al Badri is unlikely.

39	1	a	Where are the  where is the  You do know that  dosent operate in
40	1	a	But this is exactly what the Jihadis are doing, they are fighting everyone who took their lands by force and established corrupt puppet regimes so what are you blaming them for then?
41	1	a	Look how harbored this isis terrorist is
42	1	a	instead of being obssesed with what others do, whether theh shave their private parts or not why you just don't care about the PU**Y of your mother and your sister which are probably bein sold to dirty and nasty westerners

46	1	a	i dont support the usage of these bombs against any human- but they are not banned and were often used against iraq and hisbollah some years ago
47	1	a	But I‚Äôm not brainwashed. I am truly sorry that this situation exists in the Middle East but the problem is the hate In these lands.They are all killing each other. Shiite,Sunni,and Alawite all killing each other in the name of god. or did the Jews engineer this also?
48	1	a	All counterfeit/ fake .... üòÅ
49	1	a	A good djihadiste is a dead jihadist.
50	1	a	He is saying they were not assassinated by muslims. He is anti RSS who blame everything on Muslims.
51	1	a	Has Free  ,  ,  No   Women drive, Vote, Hold office    Sunni, Shia, Alawite, all the same - Syria is a secular state with regular elections incl for its President. How many countries can say that
52	1	a	Assad is an Alawite, not a Muslim. Alawites have been persecuted by Shia and Sunni for 1200 years. Iran accepted Alawites as part of the Twelver Sect under Assad's father's reign in the 1970's as a term of the alliance between Iran and Syria. Political contrivance.
53	1	a	I am pretty sure that salafi-wahhabis, which are raised in Saudi Arabia, as this is Saudi version of Islam, will listen to an Alawite and go to jihad in Iraq ? For what? for killing shias? LOL Logic, dude logic, just admit that you are an US troll and f8ck off
54	1	a	But this corridor can work for 2 ways.They either can go to the desert or from desert can go to their cityes.Probably they made some deal with Kurds.
55	1	a	Nida was even in Syria once.Its everything but cowardice.
56	1	a	apostasy is crime in many countries eg Saudi Arabia , Pakistan etc  He would have been hang even in Pakistan  But no one is killing like Jihadies if someone is Christian
57	1	a	the only solution is to topple the Alawite regime in Damascus
58	1	a	Does the regime promote sectarianism by brutalizing the majority of the country on behalf of the Alawite minority since Hafez El-Assad? Yes Did the Assad exploit and encourage jihadism whenever it was politically profitable? Yes
59	1	a	Crap

63	1	a	Also you're ignoring the truth that what you consider Iranian backed militias are in fact the natives of the lands. Houthi are natives of Yemen, Shia Iraqis are the natives of Iraq, Alawite & Shia is Syria are the natives of Syria! What the hell ISIS Saudi or army doing there?

67	1	a	You are the only one tweeting about this. So this seems highly doubtful to me tbh. If true, did you hand over the footage to the authorities?
68	1	a	So sorry for what has happened. It's a despicable crime. Thoughts are with you at this time.
69	1	a	Pls take it slow before posting this type of news It has always turned out to be false at least we know there are no barriers BTW Isis and rebels and there is sort of a mutual truce to focus on SAA
70	1	a	Not really they maybe have some people that were in alqaeda but still no proof . And i have a question why didn't America use alqaeda instead of isis why would it make another organization ?! ü§î
71	1	a	Assad is an Alawite. He is an infidel to the Muslim brotherhood as much as you and I. The Syrian constitution bans the MB. Why do you think [THEY] wanted him out so bad. He has protected Christians in Syria. I will admit I know much less about the Kurds but it sounds like this..
72	1	a	Lol your arab leader was a C.I.A puppet
73	1	a	I think they withdrawed before 6-7 days to Iraq with a large number of fighters
74	1	a	You're right, but I do remember that some historians say the flame. Not pretentious but Alawite and Alevi are different. but I am not sure.
75	1	a	What she has to stab them. Nd instead of shooting her she can ne arrested
76	1	a	Atheist for supporting secularism? The vast majority are Sunni.....
77	1	a	True. But it helps when the money comes from Israel with weapons too
78	1	a	I'm no troll. I just stated facts. And I'm certainly not desperate. Quite the opposite, I'm happy ISIS gets destroyed in Syria. They were genocidal lunatics and genocidal lunatics have to be wiped out. Aren't you happy ISIS gets destroyed?
79	1	a	She bumped her forehead. The forehead is swollen.
80	1	a	May Allah protect every single of dem
81	1	a	Indeed. For instance, do we have the Ibadi sect here? Nope. Or the Alawite? Nope. Do we have Sunni Shafi? Or Sunni Maliki? Or Sunni Hanbali? I don't think so. Very poor information gathering on part of the respected Home Minister.

83	1	a	I hope they have merci with the one that have been taken and force to fight for Assad like the one from ghouta
84	1	a	Takfir is part of Islam. But his and ISIS's ideas of takfir are extreme. If you read Abu Muhammad al Maqdisi's books, that's how they got their ideas of takfir and then they take it to extreme level.
85	1	a	USA has drawn red lines for not getting rid of the Huthis &has done in Syria in the Alawite areas since the beginning of the war&also sells weapons to the Houthis and SA at the same time on who is responsible now!Iran supports terrorism in the ME Europeans cryüò≠over nuclear deal  ¬†‚Ä¶

89	1	a	Nidal.. You are spinning mate. Be more sire ira et studio. All US forces are still inside Manbij, one US high official is there now, just as French inside city, Russian MP just came to village nearby and SAA with them - You really think that Erdo would go through 3 empires

98	1	a	two facts...basra is one of the hottest cities on earth (,by average temperature throughout the year),and basras destruction in end times is described in an Islamic rawaya or hadeeth.dont know zaeef or sahih..if some bro has this do share.i read it but cant find for now
99	1	a	Their real name is Dawlatul Islam...now make something with each and every letter that relates to Israel...... Whenever and wherever the Muslims strikes back, they are Israel Open/Secret Service
100	1	a	Source?
101	1	a	But,  promoted the  concept widely.
102	1	a	Wrong. There are several methods to conduct such operations. Maybe u dont have military knowledge and understanding. Bribes, covert unit inside the city, distracting attention maneuvers etc. History has many examples of such military skills
103	1	a	Exactly what it‚Äôs thinking. I‚Äôm having an argument with this  making takfeer on me for condemning this act and calling me a cow worshipper
104	1	a	No no. When I say past I mean areas like Ashdod. Rav Aluf Eizenkot will not allow a full scale operation like 2014 unless much more damage is taken. But if a location like Ashdod or Tel Aviv is shot at than an op will go into motion.
105	1	a	Yes, politics is important but this debate is completely different. This is a debate about what ‚Äòfamily‚Äô you belong to. I feel like I belong to many ‚Äòfamilies‚Äô... I have a Dear friend in Damascus Syria, an Alawite Muslim, who has the most beautiful soul, he‚Äôs family...
106	1	a	Into syria, a country that was 85% sunni ruled over by a mafia gang that was alawite, who was no more than 12% of the entire country's population.  Funny how all these assad/iran apologists claim they are for democracy/human rights, yet support dictatorships in both countries.
107	1	a	was one of the first to write about this, now most media is discussing the video.
108	1	a	Important News:  The fighters of Taliban of Afghanistan are negotiating a deal with the Americans who want to retreat from Afghanistan on a deal to free the sister Afia Siddique who has been oppressively arrested by the Americans for around 11 years now
109	1	a	I saw the video the attacker made as a live stream, now this.  What does social media really do to the underlying situation, the social conflict. Is this beneficial to the terrorists goals or the opposite?  Not sure, but here it goes:
110	1	a	Ok

114	1	a	@ TobiasHuch could you do something there?
115	1	a	IMO your points wd be better heard by those who might agree with you if you changed your profile picture.   Also, Assad isn‚Äôt Shi‚Äôa - or at least not in a form recognised by the vast majority of self-identified Shi‚Äôa. He‚Äôs Alawite.

117	1	a	Muhammad (yimakh shemo) attacked three separate Jewish Communities; the Banu Qaynuqa, the Banu Nadir, & the Banu Qurayza. Each community was robbed of all their possessions, their homes were stolen and their land occupied.
118	1	a	Assad is Alawite, which is a sect of Islam. Killings (between sects) is common. Dictators are normal. Beheading in public squares is normal. It's like they are 1000 years behind. Freedom is repressed by Sharia. Why would the west want this to continue spreading in our nations?
119	1	a	The rub is with Statecraft is we only get to pick the least worse: one stable Dictatorship with an Alawite Assad, or Saudis exporting Wahabism globally with culture shock in many nations. See  on this insight. pic.twitter.com/ZPoqJe27ed
120	1	a	Any video footage of the rocket barrage?
121	1	a	It seems Turks can't see anything, just a month ago they ran over a elderly Kurdish women in turkeys Kurdistan without any remorse. In the video it showed she was literally squashed.

130	1	a	When Erdogan first set up observation posts in   went over the top kissing his butt because they knew they did not have an Air Force and could not face Assad/Putin alone. They have done a 180 on this approach. What happened?
131	1	a	Right.  stated few days ago that they dont wish a war w israel YET (i hope it was not a lie LoL)
132	1	a	Unfortunately they've kill their big brother Saddam and replace it with their step brother Iran :-)
133	1	a	I would assume the advisors would fall into one of those two categories as well. Either they are a Russian officer, advising as part of the regular Russian army, or they are a private military contractor and hired to advise Syrian forces
134	1	a	"Let's not forget how this started. The ""Arab Spring"" & The Muslim Brotherhood went after Assad because he is an Alawite and allowed Christians, Muslims & Jews to live in harmony.¬†  Obama embraced the Arab Spring and US supported regime change in Egypt, Tunisia & Libya, and Syria."
135	1	a	This is what wakes up the youth of Muslims to become Mujahideen to defend the weak and oppressed because no damn UN or Arab state has ever in the history of the world done anything to stop the massacre of Muslims.
136	1	a	if he is muslim of course police will call him terrorist and if not muslim??

514	1	a	I mean if you count the 'majority' as the Alawite population as Assad probably does, then i'm sure he's massively popular (they are about 10-15% of the populace). Even they have disproportionately sacrificed themselves to maintain his family's rule.

588	1	a	The western media willfully omits telling it's audience that religious minorities in Syria (Armenian Christians,Maronite Christians, Alawite Shia Muslims, Yazidis) side with the government,because they're targeted by the jihadi rebels.
589	1	a	Syria is allied with Iran. Assad is an Alawite, an offshoot of the Shiite sect of Islam. So you want us to believe that Saudi Arabia, a Sunni kingdom is going to pay to rebuild Syria? You are beyond ignorant, and way way out of your league. Good news is you're going to jail soon.
590	1	a	To hell with Kurds, Turks or Chechens if they become servants of the enemies of Allah, i don`t care about them, don`t waste my time with this irrelevant trivial sh*t.

604	1	a	These arent ‚ÄòPro-PKK‚Äô supporters because they were actually protesting for PKK to leave the area alongside the Turkish army, this area also voted for the Kurdistan Islamic Union in the last elections so that definitely confirms their opposition to the PKK.

606	1	a	For how many hours SDF can retain entire DeirEzzor without Air-support ??? It‚Äôs a serious question.
607	1	a	Hand is fake
608	1	a	that the culprits came from Syria or that their behavior was authorized by Assad. I find it absurd to believe that a secular Alawite govt in Syria would be responsible for helping Sunni terrorists in neighboring Iraq, even if it did hate the US invasion.
609	1	a	Yes I will say the same thing but the problem is they're still destroying hospitals ,houses, infrastructure, I could not be responsible for any which I had to do all that
610	1	a	Somehow it looks fake. He walks casually to the camera but when he is close he stops and starts crying in pain. Hmmm.. pallywood much

617	1	a	Why are they (the rebels) refusing any reconciliation and prefer to continue the war? This has got to stop. Pictures of dead kids are so common, it has lost its political significance. People just scrug it off.
618	1	a	Systems where power is centralized, & individuals/communities are just collateral damage or tax slaves, is the norm for West Europe & America.  Our governments are bankrupt & terrified of the day they can no longer pretend to be solvent.  When government checks bounce...look out!

622	1	a	In Iraq things are getting worse for the Iraqi government. The EI is increasing its guerrilla actions.  Even if they lose ground in Syria or Iraq. They're going somewhere else and things aren't going to get any better.
623	1	a	You mean West Europe? Hillary's sec. State with McCain/Graham/Rubio shouldn't have ravaged Libya, Syria, or the Ukraine to impede the Dinar, gas pipes. Trump is solving that problem (even Alawite regime). Don't panic Lee, it's going to get better.
624	1	a	This can an actually blow up in they're face.
625	1	a	Specifically the Alawite sects in and around Aleppo and Damascus. Even his Alawite base has been wanting a change, a peaceful change but Assad out either way. Now is definitely not a good time for Shi‚Äôa or Sunni in the battered remains of a once beautiful multicultural place
626	1	a	Sure Alawite are a Shia off shoot but so are Ismailies, but Ismailies are not conflated with 12ers but Alawites are because your guess is as good as mine.
627	1	a	This is the right one
628	1	a	(In video, Night of 18th Ramadhan, 1440, when Ameer Mohtaram Rahimahullah was roaring with his Gun ‚Äö√¥‚Ä¢)

630	1	a	Nice green light for Israel to finish what's left of Palestinian resistance... Obvious excuse, eliminate ISIS
631	1	a	‚Äú...the Alawite/Shiite regime of Bashar al-Assad to engage in the ethnic cleansing of Sunnis from regions of Syria to be replaced by Shiites.‚Äù Fuck is this???

635	1	a	Abdullah was a child, not an army officer & Liwa Al Quds denied his membership.

636	1	a	Those rebels are terrorists. Hopefully they get decimated. They got innocent Syrian blood on their hands.

641	1	a	You're going to want to make a mental note of both the Assads' personal Alawite affiliation and the preference they've shown towards Alawites over other religions and sects, including the Sunni majority; it'll be important when the Opposition comes up. (9/)
642	1	a	Cool. But what about sandstorms?
643	1	a	It‚Äôs very interesting that so many sandstorms hit that area. CENTCOM must be eating themselves alive.
644	1	a	Do they mutilate the bodies of our martyrs in order to create fear psychosis among the youth of Kashmir?    Then this is very stupid on their part because the mujahideen and youth here consider it a privilege to get martyred and mutilated at the hands of enemies  pic.twitter.com/OxxBBQwHMt

646	1	a	Traitors they should concentrate on liberating Arab areas like Raqqa from the communist pkk first.
647	1	a	Now if they only withdraw from Iraq, Syria and Cyprus then they would have even more respect!
648	1	a	Correction: US has captured a school: If it wasnt for US the PKK would have been wiped out completely. They couldnt even defend their last stronghold Kobani in Syria without US 3 years ago.
649	1	a	Be it the SDF or the Syrian Regime, if you aren`t able to survive without the support of extern powers like the U.S & Russia then you have no business being there, you are like a foreign object in the body that causes inflammation & you have to be removed by any means necessary.
650	1	a	Nobody aspires to become a French national. If it weren't for the unfortunate conditions in the homeland, they wouldn‚Äôt seek refuge there. Most Africans' only demand is being granted dignified tolerance and acknowledgment, nothing more.
651	1	a	nidal u are missing it hating the zindiqs and kuffar asli due to their transgression by associating partners with Allah is an integral path of islam the defining deference in our hate is that we still treat them fairly and do not oppress them unlike what they do to Muslims

657	1	a	The reports are that he picked up a stun grenade fired by police which then detonated. There certainly was at least one protester who was shot in the stomach with a rubber bullet. That clip's on twitter.
658	1	a	Someone needs to end these Russian pigs! Maybe now, maybe in the future. Show no mercy.
659	1	a	You can use whatever term you want. There have been both protests and armed confrontations. The only really important fact is that everything is controlled and planned by the US and Israel, like everywhere else when people stand up against Tyrants .. I mean peaceful governments.
660	1	a	Don't worry. Al Baghdadi will meet his fate eventually, like Bin Laden. ISIS are losing territory faster than any other terrorist group.
661	1	a	"This just proves that Kurds are the same sh*t as any other Arab/Turkish secular nationalist wannabe ""Muslims"" who are ready to serve Powers like the U.S in their fight against Islam but who wouldn`t lift a finger to serve Islam/Sharia. All of you together will meet the same fate."
662	1	a	apparently not, 1 week ago Isis got reinforcement from the desert area? only logical explanation is Al-Tanf -> SE palmyra area -> pocket? Al-Tanf has access to everywhere
663	1	a	Sad, not hilarious. Also, throwing rocks at people with firearms is downright stupid and suicidal. Throw rocks at an armed Hezbollah soldier as see what that gets you. BTW - you can actually kill someone with a rock.
664	1	a	Now the Shia war criminal regime will release all the women
665	1	a	And sell it to Turkey, makes sense. Free syrian army has nothing better in mind but raping syrian IDPs.
666	1	a	Trump hanging the rebels out to dry just like he did the Kurds.

742	1	a	Assad is better than al Quaida. He believes in religious freedom. That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs hated by fundamentalist Muslims. He‚Äôs an Alawite Muslim. He allows Jews andChristians to practice their religion.Women without head coverings demonstrate FOR him to stay in power.

1023	1	a	We do support Allies. The 6 year civil conflict in Syria is along sectarian lines, with the majority Sunni party backed by the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey, and the Shia Alawite party led by Assad backed by Iran and Russia. I think we are playing a supportive role here
1024	1	a	Yes, but he is still right tho. The Regime didn`t evacuate their people from Kufriya & Fuah to give these towns to the Rebels as a gift. It's not a question of if but when the Regime will decide to start further operations to take the remaining Towns & Cities from the Rebels.

1039	1	a	The entire war in Yemen was started by Iran via the Houthis, same as the war in Syria via the Alawite government.  Iran's shia proxies are attempting to take over the entire ME to create a caliphate to bring about the al-Mahdi.  UAE & KSA are attempting to keep them contained.
1040	1	a	Apart from that, the only thing that results from it is that Muslim prisoners are retaliated against with much more severity and slowly killed.  All that is without considering that it is not Sunnah to treat prisoners of war except with kindness even if they are to be executed.

1043	1	a	Very Good.
1044	1	a	No. They're biggest mistake was causing humanitarian crisis. The only difference between IS and Assad is that Assad stops when US orders him to stop, and as a result he only gets a slap on the wrist. IS shouldn't have pursued Kobane, or atleast that aggressively before Damascus.

1080	1	a	Yep, this getting a cynical climax. The UN, not the natives, decide that 2 years is sufficient and Zionists, at that time in large majority immigrants welcomed that decision. Unfortunately, Zionists have never taken into account an UN condemnation of Israel, and there were many.

1095	1	a	Thankyou,one of the questions,i wanted to ask,too!
1096	1	a	bdw i have seen many hurriyat ( including all parties)  members r followers who speak   against mujahideen only because having differences in their ideologies.
1097	1	a	The basic  guide:  ‚Äö√Ñ¬¢ no swearing, lying or backbiting. ‚Äö√Ñ¬¢ no fighting. ‚Äö√Ñ¬¢ don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t waste time on useless activities. ‚Äö√Ñ¬¢ don‚Äö√Ñ√¥t listen to music. ‚Äö√Ñ¬¢ give in charity and help the poor. ‚Äö√Ñ¬¢ pray on time. ‚Äö√Ñ¬¢ recite and learn the Quran. ‚Äö√Ñ¬¢ make lots of Dua. ‚Äö√Ñ¬¢ make lots of Dhikr.
1098	1	a	This is the true jihad. demo non jihad
1099	1	a	What a DESPICABLE act by a COWARD! being horrible just because. this isn't about politics, but decency  Poor kid. This was painful to watch. He is just minding his own business, didn't even fight back, just wants to be left alone, maybe have a kind word said to him once n a while
1100	1	a	However the biggest mistake was that it said the Sunni population is now only 48% and the Alawite is 17%, Alawite are the same population they were before the war and that's 13%,
1101	1	a	Exactly, they don't kill innocent; terrorist kill innocent.. so every nation in order to protect their people HAVE TO kill these terrorists; and if isis hide among civil..well bye bye all, no chance to save
1102	1	a	Guys there are Amies in in idlib fighting enemies as we speak  Make dua for them and don't worry about it you have a army in your back garden.  At least make dua for the mujahideen who are doing it protect the oppressed and fighting oppressors  Jzk.
1103	1	a	For 7 plus years, the MSM portrayed the Syrian Arab Army as some kind of demonic  Alawite death squad. Well if that was the case, then why is it overwhelmingly Sunni, and why do Sunni Muslims join the  to this very day? You see, this is secular
1104	1	a	Very true
1105	1	a	are entitled to it. But not to cutting off scenes to make it look like You want it to. I mean, still You can do it, but don‚Äôt call Yourself journalist. There are plenty of such mistakes or crimes by Israeli soldiers indeed when they kill innocent person, but  You decided to
1106	1	a	who cares about haters. They will always find anything in Islam to blame...
1107	1	a	What next? Alawite self-rule? Druze self-rule? Sunni self-rule?  Kurdish autonomy on a sectarian level will never happen. Syria is not Iraq.
1108	1	a	"""Syrian Family Feud"" is hosted by a very charismatic version of Assad holding a Bob Barker Price is Right microphone with beige mic cover and he pits an Alawite Family against a Sunni one, the Alawites are ironically the more energetic ones while the sunnis are more milquetoast"
1109	1	a	Show us the pics
1110	1	a	It all depends on the operation.  If this is a fiasco they're gonna have to inform the media
1111	1	a	But Alawite... he is married to an Alawite and that‚Äôs why he is misinformed intentionally or unintentionally!!
1112	1	a	Let me Confirm First & I ll let u know !
1113	1	a	All this to appease their masters, if you are the men of spirit, kill the family of the regime and do not capture the system a red line
1114	1	a	How can i listen it?
1115	1	a	"The one who votes for a ""righteous person"" has nt commited any less Kufr than d one who votes for an evil person, just like thr is no difference btwn the one who makes dua to the dead righteous and d one who makes dua to d dead Kaafir.  b vote Daltay hai wo sab kaafir hai..."
1116	1	a	...
1117	1	a	Bad comparison. The IS inflicted heavy casualties on the YPG & the Assadists until they had to accept an agreement to let the IS Fighters & their Families leave the besieged areas & they destroyed all weapons they couldn`t carry, unlike the rebels who handed them over to Assad.

1123	1	a	The Assads are an alawite minority in a majority Sunni nation. Wealth is unevenly distributed away from the Sunni cities to Damascus and Latakia. There are no cultural or economic incentives for the Sunnis to vote for Assad. Syria. Is. Not. A. Democracy. Got it?

1142	1	a	Same thing with Eastern Ghouta, the so called red line of the revolution. While it was being attacked not a single proper rebel offensive except for the battles in Yarmouk Camp.
1143	1	a	Sectarianism is a hell of a drug. One of the first criticisms of Bashar for example is that he‚Äôs Alawite ruling over majority Sunnis. But then the army apparently has no Sunnis. Imagine that‚Äôs your criticism üòÇ
1144	1	a	Wtf?  A war criminal, a dictator is a great leader?

1153	1	a	How Assad built a propaganda army : - Rely on Syrians from minorities (Alawite, Armenians, Druze...) speaking in English.  - Make sure they talk about jihad and AQ and ISIS in every fucking interview  - Send refugees to Europe - Exploit western islamophobia with Russia  ¬†‚Ä¶
1154	1	a	Same, just a laymen here. But Akhi if you look carefully at the Hadith, ras≈´lAllƒÅh said ‚ÄúThere would arise a people from the progeny of this (man) who would recite the Qur'an glibly, but it would not go beyond their throats‚Äù. You see it says progeny, his lineage. No doubt -

1160	1	a	After the French custody, the army in the hand was handed over to the new Syrian government. In this army, Alawite is an important component of strength. The army was later adapted into a Syrian government army, and Alawite officers gradually took power in the army and government.
1161	1	a	In theory; yes.
1162	1	a	Proving once again ISIS would rather weaken the rebels than defeat Assad.

1177	1	a	Hamas fighting fire with fire is reckless and will get Palestinians killed. These useless rockets do nothing, but give Israel the excuse to bomb Gaza even harder than they normally do.

1195	1	a	They would have faced actual genocide, along with Assad's own Alawite people, whom jihadists view as heretical. Rogin is completely okay with that. I haven't read his piece but I'm sure he grossly exaggerates the case against Assad too. He's not trustworthy.

1200	1	a	There is a reason why there is not much cooperation between Baghdad and Assad. Iraq wont forget what Assad have done in the 2000¬¥s. If Russia and Damascus really collaborate with Erdogan after he tried everything to annihalate Alawite then they are bigger jerks than i thought.
1201	1	a	Saddam was executed by America and Iran and the file of killing the Kurds in the court was not opened from the beginning because they knew and they know Iran did it. We Iraqis know this, but you fooled your media and your government.

1498	1	a	Assad belongs to a religious minority, alawite. The fact that Sunni majority in Syria would vote for him in a free presidential election (with Sunni candidates) does not seem likely. however, since the only realistic alternative to his rule is IS, it is best for everyone he remains
