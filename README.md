How to use (for *nix systems):

Run frontend.py in Code. Open up a terminal and navigate to where you downloaded the files.

For example,
```
cd your_file_path/isextreme_master/Code
```
Then run the GUI.
```
python3 frontend.py
```

Troubleshooting
- You might have to download some libraries for the program to work.

```
pip install twint
```
```
pip install aiohttp_socks
```
Depending on your system and what you're using, you might have to use pip3 instead.

Other things you may need: Python3, PyQT, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, wordcloud etc. The errors will tell you if you have any missing dependencies.
